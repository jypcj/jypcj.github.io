                            In IOS, the gestures to return to previous page are different in different apps. Some require a finger swipe to the right from the left edge of the screen, while others only require a finger swipe to the right from the middle of the screen. And in some APPs, we can only return to the previous page by tapping the top left button. In my opinion, the return gesture is one of the most important interaction logics in a smartphone system and is one of the functions that all users will use frequently. However, inconsistent return gestures can cause users to unintentionally perform multiple actions, thus wasting time. In addition to this, all returning gestures in IOS only support swiping from left to right and not from right to left. In this case, it is further difficult to return to the previous page when the user is operating the phone with the right hand with one hand.
                            <br>
                            Based on the above issues, after a semester of study, I have not changed my ideas, and I will proof and elaborate on my previous ideas in more depth in several aspects, while also generating some new thoughts.
                            <br>
                            Firstly, in aspect of usability. When evaluating a design, we can think in terms of usability, such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, and satisfaction. In the case of the mobile operating system, usability is even more important. As mentioned above, the return gesture is not the same from one app to another in IOS, which means that users are not sure if their return gesture is working and will unintentionally make multiple attempts, which is not in accordance with efficiency. Also, when a user uses an app for the first time, he is not sure whether a return gesture will work or not, which potentially increases the learnability requirement. Moreover, for different APPs, since their return gestures may be different, the user cannot remember the corresponding return gesture for each APP, which also shows that the return gestures of IOS are not good in terms of memorability.
                            <br>
                            Secondly, in aspect of empathize design. When designing products, it's important to put people at the center and fully understand their needs, and to empathize with users and think about what they need. Similarly, for smartphone operating systems, users want simple and convenient operating gestures, and users also want their phones to operate according to their intuition. It is obvious that IOS has made a great effort to make the system aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. And the existing right swipe return gesture also reflects the hierarchy of the system pages. But I think what users want more than anything else is for the gestures to be intuitive and simple enough, not for them to be unable to determine whether the return gesture works in different apps. I think this is an area where the almost perfect IOS system could be improved.
                            <br>
                            Thirdly, in aspect of heuristic analysis. Heuristic analysis can be used to evaluate a design, and for IOS, usability heuristics can be used to analyse. The IOS right swipe return gesture provides a good representation of the system page hierarchy and reflects the overall consistency of the system. Since the new page moves from the right side when switching pages and overlays on the current page, this return logic fits well with user recognition. But to some extent, the different return gesture also affects the user's freedom.
                            <br>
                            Although IOS is already the most advanced and easy-to-use mobile operating system available, the return gesture is still an area of IOS that is not well designed. At present, we spend a lot of time using our phones every day, so the uncertain and uncomfortable return gestures can inadvertently waste our time. Therefore, I think this is an area that could be improved.
